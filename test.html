            <p>Neapolitan is a Sass framework for quickly building responsive,
            mobile-first designs. The use of Sass mixins allows for purely
            semantic HTML, aiding readability and accessibility for human and
            robot alike.</p>

            <h2>The Grid</h2>

            <img src="gustave.svg"></img>

            <p>Neapolitan's grid is built on Flexbox, which lends it a heap of
            flexibility. Sizes can be automatically calculated, explicitly
            specified, or a mix of both.</p>

            <p>To demonstrate usage of Neapolitan's grid, we need the help of
            Gustave, the ice-cream loving bird who is very fussy about his
            colour proportions. He decides he wants a container of standard
            neapolitan icecream: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;tub&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;chocolate&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;vanilla&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;strawberry&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>It's as simple as adding the <code>grid</code>
            mixin.</p>

            <div class="tub">
                <div class="chocolate"></div>
                <div class="vanilla"></div>
                <div class="strawberry"></div>
            </div>

            <pre><code>.tub {
    @include grid();
}</code></pre>

            <p>Deep down, however, Gustave is a strawberry bird at heart. He
            decides that his ideal container of icecream should be half
            strawberry, with the rest evenly divided between the other
            flavours.</p>

            <div class="tub-two">
                <div class="chocolate"></div>
                <div class="vanilla"></div>
                <div class="strawberry"></div>
            </div>

            <pre><code>.tub {
    @include grid();
}

.strawberry {
    @include width(1/2);
}</code></pre>

            <p>Gustave is happy with the new strawberry arrangement, but after
            some soul-searching he decides that vanilla really isn't for him.
            He's not sure exactly how much more chocolate he wants, but he
            knows that it should be more than it is currently.</p>

            <div class="tub-three">
                <div class="chocolate"></div>
                <div class="vanilla"></div>
                <div class="strawberry"></div>
            </div>

            <pre><code>.tub {
    @include grid();
}

.strawberry {
    @include width(1/2);
}

.chocolate {
    @include gobble(2);
}</code></pre>

            <p>Finally, Gustave is satisfied with the arrangement. However, he
            is about to go on a flight, where he will be forced to use his
            mobile phone to browse Twitter, his favourite website. He decides
            that for such an inconvenience he really deserves more strawberry.
            Wouldn't it be nice if his container automatically adapted for such
            changes?</p>

            <div class="tub-four">
                <div class="chocolate"></div>
                <div class="vanilla"></div>
                <div class="strawberry"></div>
            </div>

            <pre><code>.tub {
    @include grid();
}

$desktop: media-from(769px);

.strawberry {
    @include width(2/3);
    @include width(1/2, $desktop);
}

.chocolate {
    @include gobble(2, $desktop);
}</code></pre>

        <p>Hopefully the flexibility of the grid system has become clear. The
        grid itself can even accept breakpoints which influence parameters like
        direction and gutter widths.</p>
